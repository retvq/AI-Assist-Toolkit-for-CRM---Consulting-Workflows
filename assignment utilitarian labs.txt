Assignment
AI Assist Toolkit for CRM & Consulting Workflows
Realistic Demo Implementation
1. OBJECTIVE

Design and build a demo-grade, production-aligned AI assistant that supports consultants across three CRM-centric workflows:

Understanding leads quickly

Translating client conversations into execution-ready drafts

Detecting CRM data quality risks before automation

This system is assistive, not autonomous.

The goal is to demonstrate judgment, reliability, and workflow fit, not full enterprise scale.

2. SYSTEM SCOPE (STRICT)
In Scope

Single unified interface

Three clearly separated modules

Session-based processing only

Deterministic logic where applicable

AI used only for summarization and explanation

Human-in-the-loop by design

Out of Scope (Explicit Limits)

No real CRM integrations

No persistent storage

No background jobs or async pipelines

No user authentication

No role-based access control

No performance benchmarking

No autonomous decisions or execution

Any feature outside this scope is not required and not expected.

3. SYSTEM OVERVIEW (END-TO-END FLOW)

User selects a module on the main interface

User provides input relevant to that module

System validates input quality

Deterministic checks run first (where applicable)

AI processes only validated input

Output is generated as a draft

System explicitly highlights:

Observed facts

Inferred insights

Uncertainty or missing information

User reviews, edits, or discards output

At no point does the system act without user review.

4. USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
Primary Interface

Single page

Three fixed sections, always visible or easily switchable:

Lead / Opportunity Intelligence

Requirement to Delivery Translation

CRM Data Quality & Readiness Check

UI Principles

Task-oriented, not exploratory

Minimal configuration

Clear input → output mapping

Outputs presented as review-friendly blocks

No AI output presented as final or authoritative

5. MODULE 1: LEAD / OPPORTUNITY INTELLIGENCE
Purpose

Reduce time spent understanding messy lead information.

Inputs

Free-text lead notes

Email threads

Call summaries or transcripts

Inputs may be incomplete or poorly structured.

System Behavior

The system must produce:

Business summary

Explicit pain points (observed)

Inferred client intent (clearly labeled as inferred)

Suggested next actions

Output Constraints

Structured sections

CRM-ready formatting

Clear separation between facts and inference

Failure Handling

If input is insufficient:

System must state uncertainty

Must not fabricate details

Must request clarification explicitly

6. MODULE 2: REQUIREMENT TO DELIVERY TRANSLATION
Purpose

Convert client discussions into execution-ready drafts.

Inputs

Discovery notes

Informal requirement descriptions

Client messages

System Behavior

The system must generate:

Draft user stories (stakeholder perspective)

Plain-language acceptance criteria

Logical task breakdown

Explicit Restrictions

The system must NOT:

Estimate timelines

Assign ownership

Propose architecture

Make delivery commitments

Human-in-the-Loop Requirement

All outputs must be labeled clearly as:
“Draft – Requires Human Review”

7. MODULE 3: CRM DATA QUALITY & READINESS CHECK
Purpose

Identify data issues that could break automation or analytics.

Inputs

Tabular CRM data (CSV or equivalent)

Deterministic Checks (Mandatory)

Missing critical fields

Duplicate records

Format inconsistencies

Basic anomalies (e.g., invalid values)

AI-Assisted Role (Limited)

AI may only:

Explain why issues matter

Describe downstream risks

Suggest cleanup priorities

AI must NOT modify data or make destructive changes.

8. CROSS-MODULE REQUIREMENTS
Consistency

Unified terminology

Consistent output structure

Shared confidence and uncertainty indicators

Explainability

Every AI output must include:

What was observed

What was inferred

What is uncertain

Reliability

Clear error messages

Graceful handling of bad input

No silent failures

9. SECURITY & PRIVACY ASSUMPTIONS

All data is sensitive

No data is stored beyond the active session

No training or reuse of user data

AI processing can be conceptually disabled per organization

Implementation may simulate these controls.

10. DELIVERY EXPECTATIONS

The submission must include:

Working demo application

Clear system flow documentation

Explicit scope and non-goals

Explanation of design tradeoffs

Notes on how the system could be extended to production

11. SUCCESS CRITERIA

The system is successful if:

A consultant can use it during a real engagement

Outputs are trusted as drafts, not decisions

Data risks are surfaced before failures occur

The system feels reliable, conservative, and professional

FINAL EVALUATION QUESTION

For every design decision, answer:

“Would a consulting firm trust this as an internal assistant in front of a client?”

If not, the design is incorrect.
