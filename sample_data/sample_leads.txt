Subject: RE: Your CRM Platform Demo Request

Hi,

Thanks for reaching out. We're currently using Salesforce but honestly it's been a nightmare for our team of 25 sales reps. The main issues:

1. Data entry takes forever - reps spend 2+ hours daily just logging calls
2. Our reports are always wrong because nobody updates opportunities properly
3. We tried Salesforce automation but it broke more things than it fixed
4. Management wants real-time pipeline visibility but we can only do weekly exports

We're growing fast (just closed Series B - $15M) and need something that actually works with our workflow, not against it. Our sales cycle is typically 3-6 months for enterprise deals.

Budget isn't the main concern - we just need something that our team will actually use. Previous tools failed because of poor adoption.

Can we schedule a demo for next Tuesday or Wednesday? I'll bring our VP of Sales and our RevOps lead.

Best,
Sarah Chen
Head of Sales Operations
