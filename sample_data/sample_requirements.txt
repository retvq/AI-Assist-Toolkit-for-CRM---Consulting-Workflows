Discovery Call Notes - Client: GreenLeaf Organics

Meeting Date: Last Thursday
Attendees: Maria (CEO), James (Operations Manager), Us

Context:
GreenLeaf is a mid-size organic food distributor. They supply to ~200 restaurants and grocery stores in the metro area. Currently everything is manual - orders come in via phone, email, and sometimes text messages.

What they said they need:

Maria: "We're losing orders because things fall through the cracks. Last month we missed a $5,000 order from our biggest client because the email got buried. I need to see all orders in one place."

James: "The drivers don't know their routes until the morning. They come in, I hand them paper sheets, and they figure it out. It's chaos. We need something on their phones."

Maria: "I want to know in real-time where my trucks are. When a restaurant calls asking where their delivery is, I have to call the driver. It's embarrassing."

James: "Also inventory - we're always either overstocked on greens or running out. Can't it predict what we need?"

Maria: "Oh, and invoicing. We still mail paper invoices. It's 2024. Some clients have been asking for online payment."

Current pain points:
- Missed orders due to scattered communication channels
- No route optimization for 12 delivery trucks
- Manual inventory tracking in Excel
- Paper-based invoicing, slow payment collection
- No visibility into delivery status

Their priorities (in order per Maria):
1. Order management - consolidate everything
2. Driver mobile app with routes
3. Real-time tracking
4. "The other stuff can come later"

Budget: "We're not a tech company, so nothing crazy. But we know we need to invest to grow."

Timeline hint: Want to start pilot before summer busy season (3 months away)
